    <h1>Commands and Arguments</h1>
    <p>
    Bash will read everything you write in your terminal as a command, it takes the first word you type in as a command and all the following words as arguments to that command. Now we will talk about some commands.
    </p>
    <h1>ls</h1>
    <p>
    The ls command shows you what files are in your current directory. You could also type ls documents to see what files are in your documents directory for example.
    </p>
    <h1>Comment</h1>
    <p>
    By putting a # infront of whatever you type it turns that into a comment, comments are ignored by the shell and will not be read as a command.
    </p>
    <h1>Touch</h1>
    <p>
    Touch changes the Last "Modified" time of a file, if you touch a file that didnt exist prior the touch command will make an empty file with that name for you.
    </p>
    <h1>rm</h1>
    <p>
    The command rm will remove the file or directory that follows, for example if i said "rm media" it would remove a directory named media.
    </p>
    <h1>Echo</h1>
    <p>
    The command echo will take what ever follows and repeat it once, for example if you write "echo Hello" the next line in the terminal would say Hello.
    </p>
    <h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
    <p>
    ALL ARGUMENTS SHOULD BE SEPERATED FROM THE COMMAND OR IT WILL NOT WORK FOR EAMPLE "lsdocuments" WONT WORK BECUASE THERE IS NO SPACE BETWEEN THE COMMAND AND THE ARGUMENT.
    </p>
    <a href='code/module2.sh' target='_blank' >Here</a> is my practice script for all the above commands.
    <h1>I only got past commands and arguments before running out of class time</h1>
