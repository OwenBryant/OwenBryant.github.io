    <h1>Commands and Arguments</h1>
    <p>
    Bash will read everything you write in your terminal as a command, it takes the first word you type in as a command and all the following words as arguments to that command. Now we will talk about some commands.
    </p>
    <h1>ls</h1>
    <p>
    The ls command shows you what files are in your current directory. You could also type ls documents to see what files are in your documents directory for example.
    </p>
    <h1>Comment</h1>
    <p>
    By putting a # infront of whatever you type it turns that into a comment, comments are ignored by the shell and will not be read as a command.
